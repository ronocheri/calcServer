Hey, I've tested the server side and it seems to work well:

Api URL: http://localhost:3000/api/calc

run the server side with: node app.js (at pot 3000)

input example:
{
	"firstNum":"6",
	"secondNum":"3",
	"oper":"/"
	
}

output:
{
    "result": "2",
    "color": "green"
}

input example:
{
	"firstNum":"6",
	"secondNum":"2",
	"oper":"/"
	
}

output:
{
    "result": "3",
    "color": "red"
}

I've added the option for getting an answer as a JSON Object which has 2 attributes as you said.

If the result is even color=green, else "color": "red"
